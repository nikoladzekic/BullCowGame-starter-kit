# Bull Cow game

## Idea

The idea of this game is to have user guess a hidden word using terminal inside Unreal Engine.

If the user guesses wrong he loses a life. 

The amount of lives is determined by the length of the word.

## Rules

If the letter inside user guessed word is matching the letter inside Hidden Word, on the same position(__index__) user gets a __Bull__.


If there are no matching letters on same positions, we check if there are any matching letters from __User Guess__ in __Hidden Word__ on any position. If yes user gets a __Cow__.

## Gameplay

To play the game, __Compile__ using Unreal Engine, _version 4.22.3_, and then press __Play__. 

Once the game starts press __TAB__ button on keyboard, and type your word.

Once you type the desired word press __Enter__ button on keyboard.
